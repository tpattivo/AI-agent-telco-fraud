# Telecom Fraud Detection AI Agent

An advanced AI agent capable of detecting and preventing fraud in telecommunication companies on a large scale. The system analyzes vast amounts of telecom data in real-time, forecasts potential fraud before it occurs, and enables proactive blocking or flagging of suspicious calls or accounts.

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a comprehensive fraud detection system that can identify multiple types of telecom fraud:
- International Revenue Share Fraud (IRSF)
- Wangiri fraud ("one ring and cut")
- Interconnect bypass fraud
- Account takeover

## System Architecture

The system is designed as a modular, scalable architecture with the following key components:

1. **Data Sources**: CDRs, signaling data, network logs, customer profiles, and historical fraud cases
2. **Data Ingestion Layer**: Real-time and batch ingestion of telecom data
3. **Data Processing Layer**: Stream processing, feature engineering, and data enrichment
4. **AI/ML Layer**: Specialized models for different fraud types
5. **Decision Layer**: Rules engine, risk scoring, and alert generation
6. **Action Layer**: Call blocking, account flagging, and notification
7. **Monitoring & Reporting**: Dashboards, performance monitoring, and compliance reporting
8. **Feedback Loop**: Model performance tracking and continuous learning

For detailed architecture information, see the [architecture documentation](docs/architecture/system_architecture.md).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Kubernetes cluster (for production deployment)
- Python 3.9+
- Kafka cluster
- Access to telecom data sources

### Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/company-e/telecom-fraud-detection.git
   cd telecom-fraud-detection
   ```

2. Set up the development environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
   ```

3. Start the local development environment:
   ```
   docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```

4. Run the tests:
   ```
   pytest
   ```
