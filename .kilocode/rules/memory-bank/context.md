# Telecom Fraud Detection AI Agent - Current Context

## Current Work Focus

The project is currently in the initial planning and architecture design phase. We have:

1. Defined the core requirements and objectives for the telecom fraud detection system
2. Identified the key fraud types to be detected (IRSF, Wangiri, Bypass, Account Takeover)
3. Outlined the high-level system architecture and component interactions
4. Selected the primary technologies and frameworks to be used
5. Created a detailed implementation plan with phased approach

## Recent Changes

- Completed the initial architectural design for the system
- Defined the data schemas for CDRs, signaling events, and fraud alerts
- Selected containerization approach for deployment flexibility
- Outlined the ML model approaches for each fraud type
- Created memory bank for project knowledge management

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 1: Foundation Setup**
   - Set up development environment with Docker and Kubernetes
   - Implement data ingestion pipelines for CDRs and signaling data
   - Create initial data processing and feature engineering components
   - Establish monitoring and logging infrastructure

2. **Phase 2: Basic Fraud Detection**
   - Develop baseline models for each fraud type
   - Implement rule-based detection for known fraud patterns
   - Create basic alerting and case management system
   - Build initial dashboards for fraud monitoring

3. **Phase 3: Advanced AI Implementation**
   - Develop and train specialized ML models for each fraud type
   - Implement real-time scoring and decision engine
   - Create automated response mechanisms
   - Establish feedback loops for continuous improvement

4. **Immediate Tasks**
   - Set up project repository and CI/CD pipeline
   - Create development environment configuration
   - Implement Kafka-based data ingestion prototype
   - Develop initial feature extraction for IRSF detection
