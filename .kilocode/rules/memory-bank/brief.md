# Telecom Fraud Detection AI Agent - Project Brief

## Project Overview
This project aims to build an advanced AI agent capable of detecting and preventing fraud in telecommunication companies on a large scale. The system will analyze vast amounts of telecom data in real-time, forecast potential fraud before it occurs, and enable proactive blocking or flagging of suspicious calls or accounts, thereby reducing financial damage and service interruptions.

## Core Objectives
1. Detect multiple types of telecom fraud including:
   - International Revenue Share Fraud (IRSF)
   - Wangiri fraud ("one ring and cut")
   - Interconnect bypass fraud
   - Account takeover

2. Process and analyze telecom data in real-time from multiple sources:
   - Call Detail Records (CDRs)
   - Signaling data
   - Network logs
   - Customer profiles
   - Historical fraud cases

3. Implement advanced AI/ML techniques for fraud detection:
   - Anomaly detection
   - Pattern recognition
   - Predictive modeling
   - Graph analysis
   - Deep learning

4. Provide automated response mechanisms:
   - Real-time call blocking
   - Account flagging
   - Alert generation
   - Case management

5. Deploy as a containerized solution that can run in both cloud and on-premises environments

## Success Criteria
- Reduction in fraud-related financial losses by at least 60%
- Decrease in false positive rate to under 5%
- Real-time detection with latency under 500ms
- Ability to process 10,000+ calls per second
- Adaptability to new and evolving fraud patterns
- Comprehensive audit trail and reporting capabilities
